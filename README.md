## Open Box Menu

Nostlan's open box menu aims to recreate the nostalgic experience of opening a game box, admiring its contents, and popping out the game to play.

For example, here's the open box menu for _Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door_:

## Creating the Open Box Assets

I used the Adobe Lightroom app on my iPhone 6S Plus and shot in Pro mode using the raw .DNG filetype. Photos taken with the default iPhone camera app are compressed in size, reducing image quality and resolution, they don't capture what the sensor is capable of. For lighting I used a desktop light with a white bulb and daylight from a nearby window, not any yellow/orange light sources. I shot from the center of the item, laying it out as flat as possible, trying to avoid reflections. I'm not a professional graphic designer by any means but I think the results are quite good!

### Editing the Manuals and Memory Cards

I added a transparency layer and erased the backgrounds.

### Editing the Open Game Boxes

To create an [orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection) view of the open game box, I used photoshop's perspective warp tool. I placed rectangles over each section of the box, then warped those points to be perfectly straight with the edges of the image.

### Editing the Open Game Box Mask

I cut out clips and slots that appear in front of game media and manuals.
